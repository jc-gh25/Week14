Week 14 Research

1. What does JPA stand for? Why is it useful? What problems does it solve?
JPA = Java Persistence API. It defines a standard set of annotations and interfaces for mapping Java objects to relational database tables. By abstracting the low-level JDBC work, JPA lets developers work with plain domain objects instead of manual SQL strings, handles object-relational mapping, transaction demarcation, caching, and lazy loading. The result is less boilerplate, clearer business logic, and portability across different JPA providers (Hibernate, EclipseLink, etc.) without rewriting code.

2. Compare JDBC & JPA. Contrast the two approaches.
JDBC is the low-level API that gives direct, fine-grained control over SQL execution: you obtain a Connection, prepare statements, set parameters, execute queries, and manually map ResultSet rows to objects. It’s lightweight and works with any database, but requires verbose code and explicit resource management. JPA sits on top of JDBC and provides an object-oriented abstraction. With JPA you declare entity classes and relationships once.  The provider generates the necessary SQL, manages connections, transactions, caching, and lazy loading automatically. JPA reduces boilerplate and improves readability, but you lose some of the precise control and may encounter performance quirks when the generated SQL isn’t optimal. In short, JDBC means writing all the SQL, and using JPA means writing the model and letting the framework generate the SQL.

3. Why and where would using logging be useful? What library do we use in this course for logging?
Logging records runtime information like debug traces, errors, warnings, and informational messages so you can diagnose problems, audit behavior, and monitor performance without stopping the application. It can be valuable in production environments where a debugger isn’t available. In this course we use SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) together with the Lombok @Slf4j annotation, which injects a log field into the class. 

4. What is Lombok? How is it used? What benefits come from using Lombok?
Project Lombok is a compile-time annotation processor that reduces boiler plate in Java classes. By adding annotations such as @Data, @Value, @Builder, @Getter/@Setter, @EqualsAndHashCode, and @Slf4j, Lombok automatically generates the corresponding methods during compilation, such as getters, setters, constructors, toString, equals, hashCode, builder pattern code, and a logger field. The benefits are cleaner source files, faster development, and reduced chance of human error in repetitive code. To use Lombok you add the dependency to pom.xml and install the Lombok plugin in your IDE so the generated members are recognized during editing. While Lombok is widely adopted, it does rely on compile-time bytecode manipulation, which some teams treat as a “hack”. It remains supported by major IDEs and is unlikely to be phased out soon.
